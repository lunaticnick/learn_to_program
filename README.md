# Chris Pine "Learn to Program" 2nd Edition

This folder contains the code-along and exercises from Chris Pines book - Learn to Program 2nd Edition in preparation for Makers Academy On-site Course via the PreCourse.

The exercises and what I have learned in this book was the backbone of the start of my life as a Web Developer.
